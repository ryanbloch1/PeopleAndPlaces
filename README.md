Okay, James, I understand. This is a very interesting and potentially powerful concept for an app, especially for real-time insights into crowd density!

You've got a great, concise pitch for what it does. The "live data of people's movements to see how busy places are" is the core value proposition.

Given that it's in the POC (Proof of Concept) investigation phase, here's a breakdown of what that implies and some initial thoughts on the technical challenges and opportunities:

People & Places App: POC Investigation Phase
Core Idea: An application providing real-time population density and movement data for user-selected locations.
